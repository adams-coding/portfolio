            <p >I have always been passionate about coding and IT in general. 
              I have had years of self taught experience in coding ranging from front and back end design, ecommerce, blockchain and augmented reality.
              More recently i have started a 10 month coder bootcamp which is increasing both my knowledge and productivity dramatically.
                Here are some examples of my work.
